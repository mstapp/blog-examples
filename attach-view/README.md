Example Marionette application for the post "Attaching Backbone and Marionette views to existing HTML", here: http://mike.stapp.us/blog/attaching-backbone-marionette-views-to-existing-html

This is a simple Backbone & Marionette application. It doesn't need a server-side piece beyond something to serve the static HTML & assets. If you're on a Mac or you're on Windows and have python installed, you can run simple python server from the command line:

    python -m SimpleHTTPServer 3001

Click the navbar links to toggle back & forth between 2 separate views.
